<!-- Pepino is a tool to help Node developers discover new node packages.

With integrated search of the NPM library using keywords, users are able to see the description and usage statistics of node packages. Users can create representations of their node projects, add their current node packages to it and comment on the packages or other projects.

The project had three models and we were each able to experience the backend, testing and front end for our own model. I was responsible for creating the Packages model and schema for the database, and their RESTful routes. I also created the packages Index and Show pages on the website, and am responsible for the colour choice and overall styling -->
